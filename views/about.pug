					h4 Our Mission
					
					p Ang Hiyas was founded with a simple mission: to preserve, elevate, and celebrate Filipino heritage through fashion. We believe traditional Filipino clothing is more than ceremonial wear—it’s a living expression of identity, pride, and artistry. By supporting local craftsmen and using authentic materials, we help keep these traditions alive while making them relevant today.

					p At Ang Hiyas, every item tells a story—
						span a story of tradition,
						span a story of culture,
						span and a story of you.
